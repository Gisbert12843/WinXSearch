What it does:
searches through every kind of folder/file/content after predefined searchStrings; optional opening of files at the end of the search, designed to work from context menu (setup for that is still WIP)


How-To-Use:

Provide a path via console or via context menu

Pick one or multiple words to search for

Pick some files to open in explorer

Full Setup for less advanced users is still workinprogress. Stay tuned ^^
