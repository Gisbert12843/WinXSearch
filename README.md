What it does:
searches through every kind of folder/file/content after predefined searchStrings; optional opening of files at the end of the search, designed to work from context menu (setup for that is still WIP)


How-To-Use:

Provide a path via console or via context menu

Pick one or multiple words to search for

Pick some files to open in explorer

Full Setup for less advanced users is still workinprogress. Stay tuned ^^


Setup:

drop it in some folder

Create Registry Keys like you see here

The location in the registry must be the same, the name of the WinXSearch key, the MUIVerb and Path of the command default value can be changed ^^
Don't forget the %w at the end of the path and format your path the same as I did.

In some time I will also add a full setup which does all the work for you :)
